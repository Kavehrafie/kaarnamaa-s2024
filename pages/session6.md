## Salon des Refusés

<!--
more than 3000 works rejected
Édouard Manet's *Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe (The Luncheon on the Grass)* caused a stir at the 1863 Salon des Refusés, but the attention given to Whistler's White Girl was even greater.

- This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting.
- Example critics:
	- Thoré described the nude as an ugly and risqué subject matter, while describing the male on the right as one "who doesn't even think of taking off his horrible padded hat outdoors ... It's the contrast between such an antipathetic animal to the character of a pastoral scene, and this undraped bather, that is shocking."

>  ... the ultimate values which the cultivated spectator derives from Picasso are derived at a second remove, as the result of *reflection* upon the immediate impression left by the plastic values. It is only then that the recognizable, the miraculous and the sympathetic enter. They are not immediately or externally present in Picasso's painting, but must be projected into it by *the spectator sensitive enough to react sufficiently to plastic qualities.* They belong to the *'reflected' effect*. In Repin, on the other hand, the *'reflected'* effect has already been included in the picture, ready for the spectator's unreflective enjoyment. Where Picasso paints cause, Repin paints effect. Repin predigests art for the spectator and spares him effort, provides him with a shortcut to the pleasure of art that detours what is necessarily difficult in genuine art. Repin, or kitsch, is synthetic art.

> The encouragement of kitsch is merely another of the inexpensive ways in which totalitarian regimes seek to ingratiate themselves with their subjects. ... Kitsch keeps a dictator in closer contact with the 'soul' of the people.

Alain LeRoy Locke (1885--1954)

<!--

- he was the first Black American whi earn a Rhodes scholarship, received bith undergraduate degree and PhD in Philosophy from Harvard Univ.
- he go on to teach at Howard Univ. and published a book called "the New Negro"
	- a collection of essays and a manifesto

> Up to the present one may adequately describe the Negro’s “inner objectives” as an attempt to repair a damaged group psychology and reshape a warped social perspective. Their realization has required a new mentality for the American Negro. And as it matures we begin to see its effects; at first, negative, iconoclastic, and then positive and constructive. In this new group psychology we note the lapse of sentimental appeal, then the development of a more positive self-respect and self-reliance; the repudiation of social dependence, and then the gradual recovery from hypersensitiveness and “touchy” nerves; the repudiation of the double standard of judgment with its special philanthropic allowances, and then the sturdier desire for objective and scientific appraisal; and finally the rise from social disillusionment to race pride, from the sense of social debt to the responsibilities of social contribution, and offsetting the necessary working and commonsense acceptance of restricted conditions, the belief in ultimate esteem and recognition. Therefore, the Negro today wishes to be known for what he is, even in his faults and shortcomings, and scorns a craven and precarious survival at the price of seeming to be what he is not. He resents being spoken for as a social ward or minor, even by his own, and being regarded a chronic patient for the sociological clinic, the sick man of American Democracy. For the same reasons, he himself is through with those social nostrums and panaceas, the so-called “solutions” of his “problem,” with which he and the country have been so liberally dosed in the past. Religion, freedom, education, money—in turn, he has ardently hoped for and peculiarly trusted these things; he still believes in them, but not in blind trust that they alone will solve his life-problem.

> My chief objection to propaganda, apart from its besetting sin of monotony and disproportion, is that it perpetuates the position of group inferiority even in crying out against it. For it lives and speaks under the shadow of a dominant majority whom it harangues, cajoles, threatens, or supplicates. It is too extroverted for balance or poise or inner dignity and self-respect. Art in the best sense if rooted in self-expression and whether naïve or sophisticated is *self-contained*. ... in a word must choose art and put aside propaganda.

> Our espousal of art thus becomes no mere idle acceptance of "art for art's sake," or cultivation of the last decadences of the overcivilized, but rather a deep realization of the fundamental purpose of art and of its function as a tap root of vigorous, flourishing living. ...
> Propaganda itself is preferable to shallow, truckling imitation.

\-Alain Locke, "Art or Propaganda"
