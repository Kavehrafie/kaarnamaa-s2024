Room organized by Aragon, Eluard et Tanguy at the exposition The Truth about the Colonies', Le Surr6alisme au service de la revolution, no. 4,
December 1931, p. 40.

The 'Vérité sur les colonies' exposed the grim realities of colonization, contrasting the 1931 Paris Colonial Exhibition. Organized by the Surrealists, this exhibition spotlighted crimes like forced labor and demanded an end to colonization and accountability for the perpetrators

> My chief objection to propaganda, apart from its besetting sin of monotony and disproportion, is that [it perpetuates the position of group inferiority even in crying out against it.]{class="text-black bg-yellow-400"} For it lives and speaks under the shadow of a dominant majority whom it harangues, cajoles, threatens, or supplicates. 
> ...
> Propaganda at least nurtured some form of serious discussion, and social discussion was necessary, is still necessary. On this side: the difficulty and shortcoming of propaganda is its partisanship. It is one-sided and often [prejudging.]{class="text-black bg-yellow-400"}

> I do not doubt that the ultimate art coming from black folk is going to be just as beautiful, and beautiful largely in the same ways, as the art that comes from white folk, or yellow, or red; but the point today is that until the art of the black folk compels [sic] [recognition]{class="text-black bg-yellow-400"} they will not be rated as human. And when through art they compell [sic] recognition then let the world discover if it will that their art is as new as it is old and as old as new

> Thus all [Art is propaganda]{class="text-black bg-yellow-400"} and ever must be, despite the wailing of the purists. I stand in utter shamelessness and say that whatever art I have for writing has been used always for propaganda for gaining the right of black folk to love and enjoy. I do not care a damn for any art that is not used for propaganda. But I do care when propaganda is confined to one side while the other is stripped and silent.

> So, far from contradicting, diminishing, or diverting our revolutionary feeling for life, surrealism shored it up. It nourished in us an impatient strength, endlessly sustaining this massive army of negotiations. 
> ...
> Millions of Black hands, across the raging clouds of world war, will spread terror everywhere. Rouse from a long benumbing torpor, this most deprived of all people will rise up, upon plains of ashes.
> Our surrealism will then supply them the leaven from their very depths. [It will be time finally to transcend the sordid contemporary antinomies: White-Blacks, Europeans-Africans, civilized-savage:]{class="text-black bg-yellow-400"} the powerful magic of the mahoulis will be recovered, drawn from the very wellsprings of life. Colonial idiocies will be purified by the welding arc's blue flame. The mettle of our metal, our cutting edge of steel, our unique communions--all will be recovered.

> In Black Africa, art is ... participation in surreality or, more exactly, in the life forces that animate the universe.

> The Black African take pleasure in knowing the world through image and rhythm. With the European, the thread of the senses leads to the heart and head; with the Black African, it leads to the heart and guts, to the very root of life.

On a recent trip to Dakar, I spotted this woven portrait of Léopold Sédar Senghor outside his office in his home (now a museum). These tapestries were made for each of the heads of state who stayed in the tent city at Persepolis during the 2500th Anniversary Celebrations of 1971.
